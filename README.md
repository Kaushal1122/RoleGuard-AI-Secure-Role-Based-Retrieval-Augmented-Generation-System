## 📌 Problem Statement

The goal of this project is to build a secure internal chatbot system that processes natural
language queries and retrieves department-specific company information using Retrieval-
Augmented Generation (RAG). The system will authenticate users, assign roles (Finance,
Marketing, HR, Engineering, C-Level, Employees), and provide role-based access to company
documents stored in a vector database.

Users will input queries and receive context-rich, sourced responses restricted by their role
permissions. All documents for RAG are provided via a GitHub repository:
https://github.com/springboardmentor441p-coderr/Fintech-data

### Expected Outcomes
- Extract, preprocess, and index company documents (Markdown and CSV) into a vector
  database with role-based metadata tags.
- Implement secure user authentication and role-based access control (RBAC) middleware.
- Build a RAG pipeline integrating semantic search with free LLMs (OpenAI GPT or
  open-source alternatives) to generate evidence-based responses.
- Enforce role-based data access (e.g., Finance users see finance documents, Marketing sees
  marketing documents, and C-Level users have access to all documents).
- Develop a Streamlit web interface for user login, chat interaction, and role-specific
  information retrieval.
- Deploy a complete, fully documented system on GitHub using only free and open-source
  tools.


## ✨ Key Features

### 🔐 Secure Authentication
- JWT-based authentication using FastAPI.
- Users must log in to access the chatbot system.
- Passwords are securely stored using hashing (bcrypt).

### 🛡️ Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Each user is assigned a role: **Finance, HR, Marketing, Engineering, Employees, or C-Level**.
- RBAC is enforced at the **API layer** and **document retrieval layer**.
- Unauthorized access to restricted department data is strictly blocked.
- C-Level users have full access across all departments.

### 📚 Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- User queries are answered using a RAG pipeline.
- Relevant document chunks are retrieved from a vector database.
- Responses are generated **only from retrieved context**, preventing hallucinations.
- If no relevant information is found, the system responds with *“I don’t know”*.

### 🧠 Semantic Search with Vector Database
- Company documents are embedded using **Sentence Transformers**.
- Embeddings are stored persistently in **ChromaDB**.
- Semantic similarity search is performed for accurate information retrieval.

### 📊 Confidence Scoring
- Each response includes a confidence score.
- Confidence is calculated based on average vector distance of retrieved chunks.
- Helps users assess the reliability of generated answers.

### 🧾 Source Attribution
- Answers include references to source documents.
- Ensures transparency and traceability of information.

### 🖥️ Streamlit-Based User Interface
- Simple and intuitive web interface built using Streamlit.
- Role information is displayed after login.
- Users can interact with the chatbot in real time.

### 🧩 Modular & Scalable Design
- Codebase is organized by milestones for clarity.
- Separate modules for preprocessing, search, RBAC, RAG, and frontend.
- Easy to extend with new roles, documents, or models.

### 📝 Access Audit Logging
- All access attempts are logged.
- Helps in monitoring usage and debugging unauthorized access attempts.


## 🏗️ System Architecture

The system follows a modular, layered architecture designed to ensure **security**, **scalability**, and **clear separation of concerns**. It combines document ingestion, vector-based retrieval, role-based access control, and large language model generation into a unified pipeline.
